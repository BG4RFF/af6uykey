# AF6UY Ham Radio Playground (AF6UY Keyer)

Projects:
- Keyer with a good side tone (for paddle, but could add iambic)
  - Will use Arduino and a lot of the off-the-shelf packages
  - Good side tone is a must, not a buzzer
  - DDS tone generator will be based on this [article  (http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/interfaces-advanced/arduino-dds-sinewave-generator/)]
