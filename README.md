# AF6UY Key
AF6UY Ham Radio Playground

Projects:
* Keyer with good side tone (for paddle, but could add iambic)
** Will use Arduino and a lot of the off-the-shelf packages
** Good side tone is a must, not a buzzer
** DDS tone generator will be based on this article http://interface.khm.de/index.php/lab/interfaces-advanced/arduino-dds-sinewave-generator/
