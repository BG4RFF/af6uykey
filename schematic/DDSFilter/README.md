= Active Filter Design for filtering DDS output =

This directory contains LTSpice design files for an active filter.  

It has a 15dB cuttoff at 12kHz and should work well for frequencies below a few kilohertz.  Especially when the DDS is used as a side tone generator for CW at around 600Hz to 800Hz.
